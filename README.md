# Ruby OOP

A continuously evolving Ruby repository for practicing and demonstrating object-oriented concepts, small utilities, and example modules. This project is intentionally kept general â€” modules and examples will be added and reworked over time.

## Purpose

## Status
Actively developed. Structure and contents change frequently.
