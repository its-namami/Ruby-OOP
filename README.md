# Ruby OOP

A continuously evolving Ruby repository for practicing and demonstrating object-oriented concepts, small utilities, and example modules. This project is intentionally kept general â€” modules and examples will be added and reworked over time.

## Purpose
Provide a lightweight sandbox for experimenting with Ruby OOP patterns, exercises, and small demos.

## Status
Actively developed. Structure and contents change frequently.

## Contributing
Ideas, issues, and pull requests are welcome. Prefer small, focused changes and include tests or examples when possible.
